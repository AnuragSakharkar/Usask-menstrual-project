    <h2> Have you ever stared at a mountain for 4 hours in soft, unchanging light? Well, I have. It is one of the most fulfilling emotions one can feel. I was once asked to describe it to some non-mountain enthusiasts and I was at a loss for words. All I can say is - imagine the most beautiful thing you've ever seen. Now multiply the feeling you felt when looking at it by a million. That is only a fraction of the feeling you will feel if you mountain-gaze properly. However, the pictures and videos you inevitably see are not even close to what the experience is like in real life. There is only one way to think about it - to find a mountain near you, set up a spot near it (although, one must remember to respect the mountain's space), and let your eyes feast on the visage in front of you. Remember, no taking your eyes off it - enjoy the view while you can! </h2>
